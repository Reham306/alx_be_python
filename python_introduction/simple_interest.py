# Defining the variables
principal = 1000  # Principal amount
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3          # Time in years

# Calculating simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Printing the result in the required format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
